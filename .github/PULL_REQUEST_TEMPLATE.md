## Risk, Complexity, Review, and CI Classification

<!--
Codex is the default high-capability engineering reviewer for complex code changes.
Opposite-frontier cc-review is reserved for protected authority, governance,
security, finance, customer-data, model-tier, and merge-control changes.

No PR may route directly to high-frontier cc-review merely because it is important,
large, or agent-authored. It must satisfy a Tier 4 trigger or include a written
escalation reason.

## Non-claims

- This PR does not claim production readiness.
- This PR does not claim launch readiness.
- This PR does not claim live-bank readiness.
- This PR does not claim customer-data readiness.
- This PR does not claim money-movement authority.
- This PR does not claim protected approval.
- This PR does not bypass branch protection.
- This PR does not add live OAuth/banking/account-connection behavior unless explicitly scoped and gated.
- This PR does not rewrite history.

## Review Receipt

<!-- Tier-4 classification is merge-blocking: CI success alone is insufficient. Tier 4 requires a completed opposite_frontier receipt, tier4_authority_waiver, or tier4_break_glass receipt. Failed review attempts/auth failures, Codex-only review, same-family review, same-provider review, or comments saying review was attempted do not satisfy Tier 4. opposite_frontier must prove opposite frontier family, not merely a different provider label. Repeat this section for each review receipt. For the proven Copilot Anthropic route, see docs/runbooks/tier4-opposite-frontier-review-route.md; do not use OpenAI/Codex as opposite-frontier for OpenAI-built work, do not fabricate receipts, and repeat review whenever the head SHA changes. -->
